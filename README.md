# coding_journey
This is my journey about my coding experiences, everything I've been taught and learned along the way.

During the time I've been here I have learnt about Html and Css:

1. Tables
2. Forms
3. Semantic html
4. Non-semantic html
5. Classes/ID's
5. Borders/margins/padding
6. Adding images
