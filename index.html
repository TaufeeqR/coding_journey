                <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
                <p>A brief introduction into how my coding journey has been thus far. <br>It has been a new and challenging experience learning how to make a webpage using html to give structure to the page and css to style the page.</p>

            <div id="content">
            <p>My journey with life skills up till today has been a long and great experience. I was told about life choices by a family member and was given the link to apply for the course. I applied for the course in July and was patiently waiting a response, I got an email in August saying that I must come for a technical assessment and if i were to pass I would be contacted aferwards if I passed.  I went through another assessmentand then an interview an was told i got accepted into a the 2 weeks life choices and after going through the course i was accepted into the coding course. I have learned a lot about html from the time I've been here. I've also learned about css and how to use it together with html to style my webpage.</p>
